## What is A/B Testing?
A/B testing—also compares the performance of two versions of content to see which one appeals more to visitors/viewers. It tests a control (A) version against a variant (B) version to measure which one is most successful based on metrics. As a digital marketing practitioner doing either B2B marketing or B2C marketing, your options for conducting A/B tests include:

### Website A/B testing
- copy, images, colors designs, calls to action
- Splits traffic between two versions—A and B, and monitor visitor actions to identify which version yields the highest number of 1) conversions or 2) visitors who performed the desired action (eg. purchases)

### Email marketing A/B testing 
- Subject line, images, calls to action
- Splits recipients into two segments to determine which version generates a higher open rate

### Editor vs algorithm
- Compare selected by editors or content selected by an algorithm based on user behavior to see which one results in more engagement
